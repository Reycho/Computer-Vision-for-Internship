A repository of all the notable code I produced during my internship.

The relevant instructions for each project can be found inside the folders READMEs.

NB: Most of the code was written to be used on high end hardware (64+GB RAM, 24+GB VRAM) and so it may be necessary to adjust the default settings I have in place.
